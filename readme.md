# Assignment 3

Milestone 0: CMake and Unit Testing filled out 
Due: Friday, September 20, 2019 11:59 PM

Milestone 1: PCB file loading and First Come, First Served 
Due: Friday, September 27, 2019 11:59 PM

Milestone 2: Priority scheduling, Round Robin, and analysis of algorithms 
Due: Friday, October 4, 2019 11:59 PM

Note: 
1. After you run assignment3_test, the PCBs.bin will be created in the ./test directory.
   so in the ./build directory, you can run the analysis program like "./analysis ../test/PCBs.bin RR 4"; or you can simply copy and paste the PCBs.bin to the ./build directory, and then run "./analysis PCBs.bin RR 4".
     
2. You can manually copy the time analysis from console and paste it to this readme file, but directly output from your program is strongly recommended.
